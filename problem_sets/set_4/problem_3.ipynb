    "At this point, we have written code to generate a random hand and display that hand to the user. We can also ask the user for a word (Python's `input`) and score the word (using your `getWordScore`). However, at this point we have not written any code to verify that a word given by a player obeys the rules of the game. A _valid_ word is in the word list; **and** it is composed entirely of letters from the current hand. Implement the `isValidWord` function.\n",

In addition, you will want to test your implementation by calling it multiple times on the same hand - what should the correct behavior be? Additionally, the empty string (`''`) is not a valid word - if you code this function correctly, you shouldn't need an additional check for this condition.\n",
