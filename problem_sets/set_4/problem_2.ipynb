    "# Representing Hands\n",
    "A **hand** is the set of letters held by a player during the game. The player is initially dealt a set of random letters. For example, the player could start out with the following hand: `a, q, l, m, u, i, l`. In our program, a hand will be represented as a dictionary: the keys are (lowercase) letters and the values are the number of times the particular letter is repeated in that hand. For example, the above hand would be represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "hand = {'a':1, 'q':1, 'l':2, 'm':1, 'u':1, 'i':1}    \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how the repeated letter `'l'` is represented. Remember that with a dictionary, the usual way to access a value is `hand['a']`, where `'a'` is the key we want to find. However, this only works if the key is in the dictionary; otherwise, we get a `KeyError`. To avoid this, we can use the call `hand.get('a',0)`. This is the \"safe\" way to access a value if we are not sure the key is in the dictionary. `d.get(key,default)` returns the value for `key` if `key` is in the dictionary `d`, else `default`. If `default` is not given, it returns `None`, so that this method never raises a `KeyError`. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> hand['e']\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n",
    "KeyError: 'e'\n",
    ">>> hand.get('e', 0)\n",
    "0\n",
    "```"

    "# Converting words into dictionary representation\n",
    "One useful function we've defined for you is `getFrequencyDict`, defined near the top of `ps4a.py`.

    "\n",

    "{'h': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 2, 'o': 1}\n",

    "# Removing letters from a hand (you implement this)\n",
    "The player starts with a hand, a set of letters. As the player spells out words, letters from this set are used up. For example, the player could start out with the following hand: `a, q, l, m, u, i, l`. The player could choose to spell the word `quail` . This would leave the following letters in the player's hand: `l, m`. Your task is to implement the function `updateHand`, which takes in two inputs - a `hand` and a `word` (string). `updateHand` uses letters from the hand to spell the word, and then returns a copy of the `hand`, containing only the letters remaining. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> hand = {'a':1, 'q':1, 'l':2, 'm':1, 'u':1, 'i':1}\n",
    ">>> displayHand(hand) # Implemented for you\n",
    "a q l l m u i\n",
    ">>> hand = updateHand(hand, 'quail') # You implement this function!\n",
    ">>> hand\n",
    "{'a':0, 'q':0, 'l':1, 'm':1, 'u':0, 'i':0}\n",
    ">>> displayHand(hand)\n",
    "l m\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the `updateHand` function. Make sure this function has no side effects: i.e., it must not mutate the hand passed in. Before pasting your function definition here, be sure you've passed the appropriate tests in `test_ps4a.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hints\n",
    "**Testing**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Testing**: Make sure the `test_updateHand()` tests pass. You will also want to test your implementation of `updateHand` with some reasonable inputs.\n",

    "\n",
    "You may wish to review the \".copy\" method of Python dictionaries (review this and other Python dictionary methods [here](http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#mapping-types-dict)).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Your implementation of updateHand should be short (ours is 4 lines of code). It does not need to call any helper functions."
