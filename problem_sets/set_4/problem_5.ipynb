    "In `ps4a.py`, note that in the function `playHand`, there is a bunch of _pseudocode_. This pseudocode is provided to help guide you in writing your function. Check out the [Why Pseudocode?](https://courses.edx.org/assets/courseware/v1/85721a1199ca98dda55d8992bc93658d/asset-v1:MITx+6.00.1x+2T2023a+type@asset+block/WhyPseudocode.pdf) resource to learn more about the What and Why of Pseudocode before you start coding your solution.\n",
