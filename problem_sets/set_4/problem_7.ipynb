If you want (totally optional!), feel free to investigate ways of making the computer's turn go faster - one way is to preprocess the word list into a dictionary (string -> int) so looking up the score of a word becomes much faster in the `compChooseWord` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be careful though - you only want to do this preprocessing _one time_ - probably right after we generate the wordList for you (at the bottom of the file). If you choose to do this, you'll have to modify what inputs your functions take (they'll probably take a word dictionary instead of a word list, for example).\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT**:Don't worry about this issue when running your code in the checker below! We load a very small sample wordList (_much_ smaller than 83667 words!) to avoid having your code time out. Your code will work even if you don't implement a form of pre-processing as described.\n",
